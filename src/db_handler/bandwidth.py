"""
Historical bandwidth tracking, per IP.

This is deliberately NOT a quota/rate-limit enforcer (that's slowapi's job,
via DOWNLOAD_RATE_LIMIT in config.yaml). It's a dataset for spotting an
anomaly - e.g. someone slowly trickling down a large amount of data over
many small, individually-legitimate-looking downloads, which per-request
rate limits alone wouldn't catch.

Retention mirrors suncdn's quota.py: rows older than the retention window
have their IP scrubbed (not deleted), so total historical download volume
stays visible without keeping an indefinite record of who downloaded what.
